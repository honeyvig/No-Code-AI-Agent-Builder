# No-Code-AI-Agent-Builder
We are seeking a skilled No-code AI Agent Builder to create AI agents using no-code tools such as Relevance AI, Make.com, and others. The ideal candidate will have experience in designing and implementing AI solutions without the need for traditional coding. Your primary task will be to transform concepts into functional AI agents that can streamline processes and enhance user interactions. If you are passionate about leveraging no-code platforms for AI development, we would love to hear from you!
================
Below is a Python-based implementation leveraging no-code and low-code AI platforms. It serves as a guide for building and deploying AI agents using APIs and automation tools such as Relevance AI, Make.com, and OpenAI integrations.
Workflow Overview:

    Connect to No-Code AI Platforms:
        Use Relevance AI for NLP tasks and data insights.
        Integrate with Make.com for workflow automation.

    Create Agents for Specific Use Cases:
        Automate repetitive tasks.
        Provide real-time customer support.
        Perform data classification or sentiment analysis.

    API Integration:
        Set up endpoints to allow smooth communication between AI agents and external systems.

    Customization via No-Code Tools:
        Design workflows using drag-and-drop interfaces on platforms like Make.com.

Python Code: Integration Guide

This Python script demonstrates interaction with no-code tools' APIs and building a functional pipeline.

import requests

# Relevance AI API Configuration
RELEVANCE_AI_API_KEY = "your_relevance_ai_api_key"
RELEVANCE_AI_ENDPOINT = "https://api.relevance.ai/v1/"

# Example function to classify text using Relevance AI
def classify_text(text, model_name="default_model"):
    url = f"{RELEVANCE_AI_ENDPOINT}classify"
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {RELEVANCE_AI_API_KEY}"}
    payload = {
        "text": text,
        "model": model_name
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": response.text}

# Make.com API Configuration
MAKE_API_KEY = "your_make_api_key"
MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://hook.make.com/your_webhook_url"

# Function to send data to Make.com workflow
def send_to_make_workflow(data):
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {MAKE_API_KEY}", "Content-Type": "application/json"}
    response = requests.post(MAKE_WEBHOOK_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        return response.json()
    else:
        return {"error": response.text}

# Sample Workflow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example user query
    user_query = "What is the sentiment of 'I love this product but it is too expensive'?"
    
    # Step 1: Use Relevance AI for sentiment analysis
    analysis_result = classify_text(user_query)
    print("Relevance AI Analysis Result:", analysis_result)
    
    # Step 2: Send analysis result to a Make.com workflow for further processing
    make_response = send_to_make_workflow({
        "query": user_query,
        "analysis": analysis_result
    })
    print("Make.com Workflow Response:", make_response)

Features of This Code:

    Relevance AI Integration:
        Automates NLP tasks such as classification and sentiment analysis.

    Make.com Workflow Trigger:
        Sends processed data to Make.com for additional automation, e.g., notifying users or triggering further AI actions.

    Customizable Agents:
        Easily extendable for use cases like customer support, lead generation, or FAQ automation.

Next Steps:

    Set Up API Keys:
        Obtain API keys from Relevance AI and Make.com.
    Design No-Code Workflows:
        Use the Make.com visual editor to create automation workflows.
    Deploy Agents:
        Embed the Python logic into your backend or integrate it directly on your website.

This combination of no-code and Python offers a flexible approach to building powerful AI agents that are easy to scale and maintain.
